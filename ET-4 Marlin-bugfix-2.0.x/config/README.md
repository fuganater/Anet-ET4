# Configurations in this folder

On a first stage of this project, I will be uploading user tested configurations for the different ET4 series models.

- User configurations are not tested by me, as I only have the "regular" ET4 printer. 
- Everybody is free to pull a request to add its configuration here.
- Copying / pasting these files is not recommended. You can use these files as a template, but it is recommended that you create your own configuration files to ensure that you have the correct settings for your printer. You can use a side to side comparision software like [Winmerge](https://winmerge.org/) to do this job.
- Check also the [configuration.h](https://github.com/davidtgbe/Marlin/blob/ff35907c14c2814c4b7ea4a3c3df2c3da98937ab/Marlin/Configuration.h#L38) and [configuration_adv.h](https://github.com/davidtgbe/Marlin/blob/ff35907c14c2814c4b7ea4a3c3df2c3da98937ab/Marlin/Configuration_adv.h#L33) version. User configs may have older configuration versions and it is very likely to not build correctly.
